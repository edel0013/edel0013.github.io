        Hello! 
        You are probably wondering what i am going to yap about so let me break it down for you. My name is Omoome, but most people call me Tina; reason being my parents named me Valentina although I was born in the good month of <em>November..</em> the 24<sup>th</sup> to be precise. 
        Fun stuff huh? Yeah I think so too!

        I am an international student from Nigeria with a love of good rock music and indie artists.
        There is also my growing love for <abbr title="Alternative">ALT</abbr> music and the incessant need to consume a lot of anime, specifically the seinen, shojo and horror genres. It is quite enjoyable, and I suggest you give it a try. Whenever I think of a quote I remember a phrase my mom constaltly repeats <q>hit the ground running</q> _ Belinda Edelifo
