        Hello! 
        You’re probably wondering what I’m going to yap about so let me break it down for you. My name is Omoome, but most people call me Tina; reason being my parents named me Valentina although I was born in the good month of <em>November..</em> the 24<sup>th</sup> to be precise. 
         Fun stuff huh? Yeah I think so too!

        I’m an international student from Nigeria with a love of good rock music and indie artists. There is also my incessant need to consume a lot of anime and pop culture content, specifically seinen, shojo and expressive makeup. It is quite enjoyable, and I suggest you give it a try!
