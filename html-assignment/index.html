            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a creative with a strong interest in anime, media, fashion, and self-expression. I enjoy exploring different ways to tell stories, whether that is through visual design, makeup artistry, or digital content. I am also the <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> of  The Sensei Experience which is a haistyling business i started to make ends meet, which sparked my curiousity and love for experimenting with new ideas and hairstyles.It is going on it's 2<sup>nd</sup> year, and i am so proud of myself for keeping it up!!</p>
            <p> I love that being a creative allows me to <em>challenge conventional standards</em> and create something that feels authentic and intentional. Outside of my creative work, I enjoy reflecting, learning, and having meaningful conversations about culture, identity, and growth. I am drawn to projects that center community, confidence, and individuality, and I am always looking for ways to develop my skills while staying true to myself.</p>
